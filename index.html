    how to win:<br>
    The main goal of this game is to not get the bomb card. After 8 <br>
    rounds of the game, the person who has it will lose. Therefore, the <br>
    players have to make sure they don't have the bomb card. But, the <br>
    bomb card cannot be discarded during the odd number rounds. It can <br>
    only be discarded by the even number rounds. +, One ultimate way to <br>
    win is by guessing who has the bomb card with the bet card, but that may lead to the lose+<br>
    * One odd case is that no one gets the bomb card. In this case, <br>
    the person that has the highest number in their hand, or has the<br> 
    bonus card wins.

    <p>
    The bonus card:<br> 
    *The bonus card is a special card. It can be used in the odd number<br> 
    rounds, round 1, 3, 5, and 7 and it allows you to throw away one more<br>
    card with it, and take back two cards with it from the mixed deck. This way,<br>
    you would have less possibility of getting the bomb. furthermore, if<br>
    you do not want it used this way, the bonus card can also be used in<br>
    the even number round, and you are able to excahnge 2 times with<br>
    any player, and it can be the same player.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The bet card:<br>
    The bet card can be used at the very end. The person that has the <br>
    bet card can guess who has the bomb card, then if the person gets<br>
    the guess right, then the person will become the ultimate winner.<br>
    However, if the person gets the guess wrong, the person will become the <br>
    person with the bomb. And he or she would lose. Using this bet card <br>
    isn't a must but you can choose to take the risk if you want to. If you don't, and<br>
    you do not have a bomb card, it would be a tie between you and the<br>
    other person who doesn't have the bomb<br>
    </p>

    card. And after the discard of one card, you must take a new card<br>
